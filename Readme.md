Array Binary Tree
-----

Generate a array stored binary tree from a sorted list.

## Files
- `arrtree.cpp` is a bad practice.
- `arrtree2.cpp` is not a balaced binary tree.
- `arrtree4.cpp` is a balaced binary tree.

## Functions
- `output` is for pre-order traverse.
- `draw` is trying to draw the hierarchy of a tree.
